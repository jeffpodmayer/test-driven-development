# Test Driven Development with JUnit Testing

## Description
This project demonstrates the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD) by utilizing JUnit testing to write methods for a custom ArrayList implementation. The focus is on creating methods for adding, retrieving, and resizing elements within the ArrayList, ensuring that each method meets its requirements through rigorous testing.

## Why?
Test Driven Development promotes better software design and code quality by writing tests before the actual code. This approach helps identify edge cases and ensures that the code is functioning as intended. This project showcases the effectiveness of TDD in creating a reliable and maintainable custom data structure.

## Quick Start
To explore the TDD project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3. Run the JUnit tests to see the results of the test-driven development process.

## Usage
1. Each method of the custom ArrayList is tested through corresponding JUnit test cases.
2. Modify the test cases or the implementation to see how changes affect the functionality and test outcomes.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the Test Driven Development project, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-feature`).
5. Submit a pull request for review.
